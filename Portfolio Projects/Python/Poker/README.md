This project is still in its starting stages.



My plan for this project is to make a browser based poker game. The type of Poker is
one player 5 card draw. The back-end logic for the poker will be in Python.

Back-end logic is about 80% just working on code to calculate what hand the player has
at any gvien stage.



I have not set exactly how and what stack I plan on using for this,
will update once the plan is more solid.
